# Things I want to do for cornn flaek

High Priority is stuff I need to do before I can merge into main (i.e. everything "just works", if barely). Low priority
is nice to haves. Mid is the same as low, but I want it before low.

## High Priority

- [ ] Ewww
- [ ] Clipboard manager
- [ ] App launcher

## Mid Priority

- [ ] Better Hyprland conf
  - [ ] Transparency
  - [ ] More useful keybinds
  - [ ] Sleep on close screen
- [ ] Bluetooth
- [ ] Sound UI
- [ ] Hibernate and all that jazz
- [ ] power profiles daemon

## Low Priority

- [ ] Firefox: Add addons such as `tabs2txt` & `Image Seach Options` using [Mozilla Add-ons to Nix].
- [ ] SSDM theme: make an SDDM module for stylix? See [instructions on GitHub] and [this SDDM theme].
- [ ] Hyprland: make a hyprland module for stylix?
- [ ] Impermanence: Get it working less jankily??
- [ ] Agenix: GPG Private Keys?

# How to set up a device

This is a rough guideline on what to do to get this working. Mostly for me.
INCOMPLETE

- create a subvolume called @blank which is used for all rollbacks
- follow https://mt-caret.github.io/blog/posts/2020-06-29-optin-state.html
- devices have names (corresponding to the actual thing)

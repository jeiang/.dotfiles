# Dotfiles

Currently a backup of my NixOS config. Some things here are not set up all that well (still a novice).

Based on [this tutorial from Wil Taylor](https://linktr.ee/nixos).

## Notes
- Unstable branch is installed for main user (aidanp) as <unstable>
- Unstable branch is installed for system as <nixpkgs-unstable>

This repository is home to the nix code that builds my systems. Currently just my server.

## Why the name?

I saw a guy name his flake frosted flakes, and cornn flaek just popped into my head.

## Acknowledgements

I have used tutorials/configs from the below people (and maybe a few others which I have forgotten). This is updated as I rework and re-make this setup.

- [Wil Taylor]: I used his tutorials for my initial setup, and it got me into nix/NixOS.
- [mt-caret]: Used a tutorial from them for setting up an encrypted btrfs w/ NixOS & impermanence.
- [Mysterio77]: Used his flake configs before this, and fiddling with them helped me understand nix better. (Also clued
  me into btrfs wipe w/ systemd stage 1 through his personal flake.)
- [Lord Valen] & [Divnix]: Divnix for Digga (used to make a prior version of this flake) and Lord Valen for the config that was used
  for this setup.
- [danth]: Stylix is amazing, and I hope it supports even more stuff.
- [hexa & kjhoerr]: kjhoerr asked a question for something I had wanted to do for a while (same partial tutorial too).
  hexa answered.
- [JavaCafe01]: I saw the frosted flakes and immediately thought `cornn flaek`.
- [srid]: I used his `nixos-flake` as a base for a prior version of this flake.
- [Vimjoyer]: Used some of his Youtube videos as a reference (e.g. setting up sops).
- [Ryan Yin]: Helped me remove some of the unnecessary stuff that I had in the repo when I was reworking.
